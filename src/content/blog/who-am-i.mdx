import MorseCursor from '@/components/MorseCursor.astro';

<div data-signal="-.-. --- -. -. . -.-. -"></div>

# Who Am I?

```bash
~$ whoami
kannan
~$ whoami --verbose
Searching...
```

<div data-signal="-- ."></div>

This is a simple blog about myself and my interpretation.

Who am I?

*Kannan.*

No, that is my name.

<div data-signal=".- -"></div>

Who am I?

*A computer engineer.*

No, that is my designation.

Who am I?

*A son. A husband. A father.*

No, those are my roles.

So really... who am I?

I am searching for that. That's all I have now.

---

<div data-signal="-.- .- -. -. .- -."></div>

And I am not alone in this search.

Ask a philosopher — *"You are a soul."*

Ask a religious person — *"You are a child of God."*

Ask a physicist — *"You are particles, vibrating in empty space."*

Ask a chemist — *"You are molecules, bonded and reacting."*

<div data-signal="---.. ....- ---.."></div>

Ask a biologist — *"You are flesh, cells dividing and dying."*

Ask an astronomer — *"You are stardust, briefly conscious."*

Everyone has an answer. Everyone has an interpretation.

<div data-signal=".--.--."></div>

But me? I am still searching.

And maybe that search *is* the answer.

---

In every system I touch, `whoami` gives me a hostname. A clear answer. A defined identity.

<div data-signal=".--. .-. --- - --- -."></div>

```bash
~$ whoami
kannan@human-being-human
```

If only life were that simple.

---

<div data-signal=".-.-.-"></div>

So welcome to my world.

A world where I share my life. My knowledge. My experiences. My failures. My 2am ideas. Everything I have.

This blog is my `stdout` — whatever is running in my head, dumped here for anyone who wants to read.

Oh, and one more thing.

I like puzzles. I like secrets. I like people who look deeper.

<div data-signal="-- ."></div>

So somewhere in my posts, there will always be something hidden. A message. A puzzle. A breadcrumb.

If you find it, reach out. Let's connect. Let's make this world a little better, one curious mind at a time.

---

```bash
~$ echo "Welcome to my world"
Welcome to my world
```
