I was racing. We all are. 300 miles per hour. Moment per heartbeat. Notification per breath.

If we are living in 2025, we already know this — life has become an F1 race. We are consumed by so much that we forget what we are even doing in this world.

The common wisdom is to count your blessings. And it is wise. Gratitude is a practice we all must have. But here is the problem — we are in a race. We never stop. We never hit the brakes. We never take a pause long enough to ask ourselves: what are we? What are we really doing here?

We are caught in a doom scroll. Not just on our phones. In life itself. Rounding and rounding. Again and again. Thinking we're moving forward when we're just... spinning.

This is where a different thought comes in. Not count your blessings. Count your days.

Many people do pause. Life forces everyone to stop at some point. But the race is so intense that most forget to finish the pause. They forget to sit in the reflection long enough for it to matter. They jump back before the stillness speaks.

I've caught myself boasting. Look how far I've come. Look what I've built. Look who I've become. But did I count the days that brought me here? Did I count what I lost while counting what I gained?

Change is easy to claim. It is harder to measure honestly.

Count your days is not a morbid thought. It is a ticking clock that already lives in your body. It whispers — you will not be the same as you are today. Some day, your body will stop moving. Your mind will stop thinking. Your mouth will go silent. Your eyes will lose their sharpness. You will not experience rage or fear or frustration anymore. But you will also not experience kindness. Not joy. Not wonder. Nothing.

And if you never paused to count your days, you may arrive at that moment realising you changed nothing. You just sat in a place where you felt powerful. You boasted your uniqueness. But you never questioned it.

We are all just a question. A [whoami](/blog/who-am-i) with no clear answer.

So I'm telling myself now — and maybe you need to hear it too.

Count your days.

Your anger has a number. One day, you won't feel it. Your pride has a number. One day, it won't matter. Your love for things — material, control, power — numbered. Your attachment — numbered. Your heartbeat — numbered.

At least with this knowing, you can carry a kinder heart and a clearer mind. Nothing is permanent. Everything is temporary.

You are a human being. You came to this world for a reason. But being human — that is the real reason you are here.

So here's my invitation to myself. And to you, if you're still reading.

Pause. But this time — finish the pause. Let the reflection land.

Count your days. Not with fear. With clarity. Not with panic. With presence.

The temporary is counting your permanent days.

Oh — and if you looked deeper, you already know. The curious ones always do.
