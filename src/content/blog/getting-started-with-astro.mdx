# Getting Started with Astro Framework

Astro is a modern web framework that makes it easy to build fast, content-focused websites. In this post, we'll explore how to get started with Astro and build your first project.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a JavaScript-based static site generator that combines the best of both worlds: the performance benefits of static generation with the interactivity of modern web components.

### Key Features

- **Partial Hydration**: Only the components that need interactivity are sent to the browser as JavaScript
- **Content Collections**: Built-in support for organizing and managing content
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework
- **Excellent Performance**: Optimized for speed out of the box

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

### Project Structure

```
project/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── styles/
├── astro.config.mjs
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Creating Pages

Pages in Astro are incredibly simple. Just create `.astro` files in the `src/pages/` directory:

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
---

<Layout title="Home">
  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
</Layout>
```

## Integrations

Astro comes with official integrations for popular frameworks:

- Vue
- React
- Svelte
- Preact
- Solid.js
- Alpine.js

## Performance

One of Astro's main strengths is its focus on performance. By default, Astro sends zero JavaScript to the browser. You can add interactivity selectively using the `client:` directive.

## Conclusion

Astro is an excellent choice for building modern websites that are fast, maintainable, and scalable. Whether you're building a blog, documentation site, or portfolio, Astro has you covered.
